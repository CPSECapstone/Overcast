# CloudHaven - Product Vision
CloudHaven provides a service for users to contain all of their important portals and applications, such as healthcare, banking, etc., in one place. 

CloudHaven will be a service for applications to use to build their front-end UI, UI-as-a-service.

CloudHaven will keep user data safe and secure by holding all personal information in one place, rather than spread out across many applications. 

This tool will also provide a messaging system that gives a platform for vendors to communicate effectively with their customers.

The future goal of CloudHaven is to give users the ability to customize the interface for different applications.
